Welcome to the PKM Knowledge Laboratory! This vault follows a hybrid P.A.R.A. + Zettelkasten system designed for active learning.

## 🎯 The Hybrid System Explained

**P.A.R.A. Method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) provides our organizational structure:
- Organizes by actionability and timeframe rather than topic
- Clear distinction between active projects (with deadlines) and ongoing areas (responsibilities)
- Everything has a place based on when you'll use it

**Zettelkasten** ("slip box") adds our knowledge-building methodology:
- Atomic notes: one concept per file for maximum reusability
- Extensive linking: ideas connect to form emergent insights
- No rigid hierarchy: structure grows organically through connections

**The Synergy**: P.A.R.A. gives us the containers (where things go), while Zettelkasten provides the content method (how knowledge connects). Add status tags for learning progression and LLM testing for validation, and you get a true knowledge laboratory!

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

### Main Categories (P.A.R.A. Method)
- **00-Projects** - Active projects with deadlines
- **10-Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities (PhD, Software Engineering, Islamic Studies, Languages, Personal)  
- **20-Resources** - Knowledge database (concepts, people, books, articles)
- **30-Archives** - Completed projects and inactive areas
- **40-Templates** - Note templates for consistency
- **50-Inbox** - Temporary capture zone (process regularly!)

## 🎯 Learning Areas

### 11-PhD-Studies
### 12-Software-Engineering  

### 13-Islamic-Studies

### 14-Language-Learning

## 🏷️ Status Tag System
Track your learning progress with these tags:
- `#status/to-learn` - Haven't started yet
- `#status/learning` - Currently studying  
- `#status/tested` - Knowledge tested with LLM
- `#status/mastered` - Confident understanding

## 🧠 Active Learning Workflow

### 1. Capture (50-Inbox)
- Drop quick thoughts, links, ideas here
- Process daily/weekly - don't let it pile up!
### 2. Process & Connect (20-Resources)
- Create atomic notes (one concept per note)
- Use `[[double brackets]]` for linking
- Add relevant tags for discovery
### 3. Active Learning (10-Areas)
- Update MOCs with learning status
- Use templates for consistency

## 📥 Inbox - Processing Guidelines

The inbox folder (50-Inbox) is for capturing quick thoughts, links, and ideas that need to be processed later.

### Processing Workflow
1. **Daily:** Review and sort items from inbox
2. **Weekly:** Ensure inbox is completely cleared

### Where Items Should Go

#### Quick Notes → Areas
- Meeting notes → Relevant area folder
- Learning insights → Active learning folders
- Research ideas → Relevant subject area

#### Resources → 20-Resources
- Articles → `20-Resources/articles/`
- Book notes → `20-Resources/books/`
- Concept notes → `20-Resources/concepts/`

#### Projects → 00-Projects
- New project ideas
- Project-specific notes

#### Archive → 30-Archives
- Completed items
- Old projects

### Inbox Rules
- **No permanent storage** - everything must be processed
- **Date stamp** new items: `YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]`
- **Tag with processing priority**: #urgent #this-week #someday

**Keep this folder clean!** ✨
